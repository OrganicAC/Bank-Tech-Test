# Bank-Tech-Test

This is a tech test for Maker's Academy

### How to use
Fork the repo, then follow the below:
```
> bundle install
> irb # Or your preferred repl
> require './lib/account.rb'
> account = Account.new
```
With the ruby file loaded, you can use the following commands:
```
account.balance # shows the current account balance
account.deposit(amount) # deposits the amount given in brackets
account.withdraw(amount) # withdraws the amount given in brackets
account.print_statement # will print a statement showing you your transactions in reverse chronological order
```

### Approach

I started with a Diagram to outline how I generally wanted the test to be, including the three classes and how they would interact at a basic level. I then moved through my user stories, attempting to TDD as much as possible, and linted with Rubocop as I went. Once I was happy, I looked through my Simplecov coverage to bring my test coverage up, then ran Rubocop one final time.
